# SeleniumBDD-GoogleCloud
Selenium Automation with GCP BigQuery API data verification - Simple proof of concept & playground


## Objective

To create a BDD Test Automation framework that compares data stored locally against data stored in the cloud. Ideally, users can query a select number of public datasets in BigQuery by making API requests. Responses are then interpreted and compared against previous versions of that same data, yes you guessed it, regression testing. Selenium usage is within the scope but not a priority, perhaps it can be used as a mechanism to push new data into the cloud datasets or to automate the cloud console. 

## Stack

* Java
* Cucumber
